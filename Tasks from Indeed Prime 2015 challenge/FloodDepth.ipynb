        "We simplify the problem in 2-D dimensions. The whole landscape can be divided into small blocks and described by an array A of length N. Each element of A is the altitude of the rock floor of a block (i.e. the height of this block when there is no water at all). After the rainfall, all the low-lying areas (i.e. blocks that have higher blocks on both sides) are holding as much water as possible. You would like to know the maximum depth of water after this entire area is flooded. You can assume that the altitude outside this area is zero and the outside area can accommodate infinite amount of water.\n",
